In consideration of the foregoing license grants, including the payment of any fees which may be due, Licensee agrees that it shall: (a) furnish Licensor with the name, address, telephone number and email address for any IBM Customer that Licensee markets or demonstrates the Software and Documentation to pursuant to paragraph 3.1(a), and (b) require each sublicensee under paragraph 3.1(b) to create an Apex account by submitting their username, contract name, title, and email address on a registration page contained on the IBM product.

6. Warranty Disclaimer.

6.1 Licensor warrants the Software and Documentation is being provided “AS IS,” and makes no separate warranty as to its performance.

Licensee will not send or provide Licensor access to any personally identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that Licensor may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to Licensor or the loss or disclosure of such information by Licensor, including those arising out of any third party claims.

8. Confidentiality.

8.1 During the term of this Agreement, Licensee acknowledges and agrees it may have access to certain information that is considered confidential or proprietary by Licensor.

8.2 Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it shall only use the Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement, and that it shall maintain the confidentiality of Licensor’s Confidential Information in the same manner in which it protects its own confidential information of like kind, but in no event shall it take less than reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information.

8.3 Licensee is permitted to disclose the Licensor’s Confidential Information to its employees, contractors and IBM Customers on a need-to-know basis only, provided that such employees, contractors and/or third parties have written or legal confidentiality obligations to Licensee that are no less stringent than those contained in this Agreement.

8.4 The confidentiality provisions of this Agreement do not apply to information:  that is or becomes generally available or known to the public through no act or omission of the receiving party; was received lawfully from a third party through no breach of any obligation of confidentiality owed to the disclosing party; or created by a party independently of its access to or use of the Confidential Information.

8.5 Upon termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall return the Confidential Information and shall not use Licensor’s Confidential Information for its own, or any third party’s benefit. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive termination of this Agreement for so long as the Confidential Information remains confidential.

9. Ownership.  Licensor is the owner or licensee of all intellectual property rights in and to the Software and Documentation, including copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, patents, and know-how. Licensee acknowledges the foregoing and agrees to implement software protection measures designed to prevent unauthorized use and reproduction of the Software or Documentation, including, but not limited to, keeping the Software and Documentation in a secure place, under reasonable access and use restrictions not less strict than those applied by Licensee with respect to its own confidential information.

10. Indemnification.  Licensee shall defend, at its sole expense, any claim against Licensor arising out of Licensee’s (a) use of the Software and/or breach of this Agreement; and/or (b) any assertion that Licensee made false, misleading and/or otherwise deceptive statements with regard to Licensor and/or the specifications, features or capabilities of the Software; and shall indemnify and hold Licensor harmless from and against any and all damages, fines, penalties, costs, expenses and/or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) awarded or assessed against Licensor in association with the above.

11. Taxes.  If any authority imposes on the Software or Licensee’s use of the Software a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on Licensor’s income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount.  Licensee is responsible for any personal property taxes for the Software from the date that Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy or fee for the import into or the export, transfer, access or use of the Software outside the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any amount imposed.
